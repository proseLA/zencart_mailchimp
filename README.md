# MailChimp Integration for Zen Cart

Version 4.0

This work is based on a [this PR](https://github.com/mailchimp/APIv3-examples/pull/25) for the https://github.com/mailchimp/APIv3-examples project.  When this project creates a sample integration in PHP (whether or not it is based on the original work I used) I will likely update this integration to keep it more or less aligned.

This example is used in the following Zen Cart contributions: 

* [MailChimp Integration](Zen Cart MailChimp)
* [Newsletter Discount](Zen Cart Newsletter Discount)
