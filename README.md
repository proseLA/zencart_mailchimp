Version 4.2

This project is based on [this PR](https://github.com/mailchimp/APIv3-examples/pull/25) for the https://github.com/mailchimp/APIv3-examples project.  When this project creates a sample integration in PHP (whether or not it is based on the original work I used) I will likely update this integration to keep it more or less aligned.

This example is used in the following [Zen Cart](https://github.com/zencart/zencart) contributions: 

* [MailChimp Integration](https://www.thatsoftwareguy.com/zencart_mailchimp.html)
* [Newsletter Discount](https://www.thatsoftwareguy.com/zencart_newsletter_discount.html)
